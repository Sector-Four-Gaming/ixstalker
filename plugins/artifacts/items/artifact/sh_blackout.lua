ITEM.description = "A glowing artifact in the shape of an orb. The Blackout artifact glows a dull red, and ‘eats’ light nearby, removing it and rendering the nearby area almost pitch black, save for the small light emitted by it. Functions locally, as in if within a particular room, it will not pass through walls and absorb light from without, only from within an area. It will function up to a radius of 10ft. It also completely disables any NVGs within the area.";
